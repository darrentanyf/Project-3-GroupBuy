# Project-3-GroupBuy


## Introduction
A team effort in creating a group buying platform to simplify the process of group buys as compared to using Google Docs or Facebook Groups. We realized that even though group buys are popular these days, they are often arranged through Facebook Groups or using Google Docs which can be tedious in terms of tracking and lacks the ability to track those who have joined automatically. Hence GroupBuy aims to allow users to organize and join Group Buys, as well as track all the group buys joined.
